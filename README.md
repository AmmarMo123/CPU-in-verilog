This code was part of the EECS 2021 course for York University. The optional prelabs provided helped guide the process of writing this code.

Basic components (and, or, not gates) in Verilog were used to create more complex systems such as multiplexers and ALUs (with adding, subtracting and comparing functionalities). 

Registers and a Memory component were also used to create circuits for instruction fetch, instruction decode, instruction execute, memory and writeback to allow for a pipelined implementation for processing RISCV instructions.

The RISCV code used to test this CPU is also provided along with their binary representations.
